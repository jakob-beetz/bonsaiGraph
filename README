![img/bonsaiGraph_usage.gif](img/bonsaiGraph_usage.gif)

This addon is meant to improve the understanding of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files and their structure. It is a tool to visualize instances of an IFC file loaded into BonsaiBIM , the relationships between instances, and the properties of each instance.

To use, [BonsaiBIM](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/bonsai/) and 'graphviz' must be installed on your system. You can install it for any platform from [here](https://www.graphviz.org/).


## Installation:
Goto the 'Preferences' menu in Blender, select 'Add-ons', and then click on the 'Install From Disk...' button. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the addon and select the zip file. After installation, enable the addon by checking the checkbox next to its name.

## Usage:
1. Load an IFC file into BonsaiBIM.
2. Select an IFC instance in the 3D view.
3. Open an Image Editor window and select the 'Ifc Hierarchy ' node.

Hope this is useful to you!
Open to ideas for improvement.
