## Installation:
- Download a release .zip file,
- goto the `Preferences` menu in Blender,
- select `Add-ons`, and then click on the `Install From Disk...` button.
- Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the addon and select the zip file. After installation, enable the addon by checking the checkbox next to its name.

## Usage:
1. Load an IFC file into BonsaiBIM.
2. Select an IFC instance in the 3D view.
3. Open an Image Editor window and select the 'Ifc Hierarchy ' node.

Hope this is useful to you!
